# AI News Agent

**Agent Name:** AI News Agent

AI News is an intelligent information summarization agent designed to help executives and decision-makers stay on top of the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence. By continuously scanning credible news sources, it identifies and summarizes the most impactful AI developments‚Äîespecially those relevant to the Microsoft ecosystem, healthcare, and construction industries.

The agent reduces information overload by prioritizing high-value updates and presenting them in a clear, digestible Markdown table format. Each summary includes a headline, date, key insight, strategic implications, and a verified source link.

AI News is not a replacement for human analysis or legal due diligence. Instead, it augments executive awareness by surfacing credible developments that may require further attention or discussion. All strategic decisions and compliance assessments remain the responsibility of the end user.


## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Daily Team Briefing:** Generate a morning digest of AI developments for Microsoft product teams.
2. **Industry Watch:** Provide Healthcare or Legal compliance teams with up-to-the-minute AI news.
3. **Executive Snapshot:** Deliver a concise AI highlights report to executives.

## üîç What It Does

- Searches Bing News via the BingGroundedSearchTool for the latest AI developments (last 24 hours PT)
- Filters by publication date and credible domains (e.g., gartner.com, reuters.com, wired.com, mit.edu, stanford.edu)
- Prioritizes items in this order: Microsoft+Healthcare ‚Üí Microsoft+Legal ‚Üí Healthcare ‚Üí Legal
- Summarizes each development and outlines implications for the three focus areas
- Outputs in a Markdown table with columns: Headline, Date, Summary, Implications, Link

## üß† Agent Instructions

The agent follows a system prompt that enforces:
- Source filtering against a predefined list of credible domains
- Publication date constraint within the 24‚Äëhour window
- Priority order for topic groups
- Consistent Markdown formatting for the output table

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/azure-ai-agent-service-blueprints.git
cd azure-ai-agent-service-blueprints/ai-news
```

### 2. Provision Azure Resources with Bicep
This Bicep script will:
- Reference your existing Azure AI Agent Service project and model deployment  
- Create a Bing Grounding resource and connect it to your Cognitive Services account  
- Provision a Storage Account, App Service Plan, and Function App  

Run:
```bash
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group <rg> \
  --template-file deploy.bicep \
  --parameters functionAppName=aiNewsApp account_name=<your-cognitive-account-name>
```
- Replace `<your-cognitive-account-name>` with the name of your existing Cognitive Services account.  
- The script creates a Bing Grounding account named `bingsearch-<your-cognitive-account-name>` and a connection.

### 3. Create a `.env` file
In the project root, create `.env` containing:
```ini
PROJECT_ENDPOINT=<your-ai-agent-service-endpoint>
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-openai-model-deployment-name>
BING_CONNECTION_ID=<leave blank; Function App app setting will be injected>
```

### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Create `system_prompt.txt`
Refer to the main README for your prompt content.

### 6. Run the agent locally
```bash
python template.py
```
7. (Optional) Review and modify configuration in `template.py`.
