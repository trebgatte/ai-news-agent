# AI News Agent

**Agent Name:** AI News Agent

AI News is an intelligent information summarization agent designed to help executives and decision-makers stay on top of the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence. By continuously scanning credible news sources, it identifies and summarizes the most impactful AI developments‚Äîespecially those relevant to the Microsoft ecosystem, healthcare, and construction industries.

The agent reduces information overload by prioritizing high-value updates and presenting them in a clear, digestible Markdown table format. Each summary includes a headline, date, key insight, strategic implications, and a verified source link.

AI News is not a replacement for human analysis or legal due diligence. Instead, it augments executive awareness by surfacing credible developments that may require further attention or discussion. All strategic decisions and compliance assessments remain the responsibility of the end user.


## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Daily Team Briefing:** Generate a morning digest of AI developments for Microsoft product teams.
2. **Industry Watch:** Provide Healthcare or Legal compliance teams with up-to-the-minute AI news.
3. **Executive Snapshot:** Deliver a concise AI highlights report to executives.

## üîç What It Does

- Searches Bing News via the BingGroundedSearchTool for the latest AI developments (last 24 hours PT)
- Filters by publication date and credible domains (e.g., gartner.com, reuters.com, wired.com, mit.edu, stanford.edu)
- Prioritizes items in this order: Microsoft+Healthcare ‚Üí Microsoft+Legal ‚Üí Healthcare ‚Üí Legal
- Summarizes each development and outlines implications for the three focus areas
- Outputs in a Markdown table with columns: Headline, Date, Summary, Implications, Link

## üß† Agent Instructions

The agent follows a system prompt that enforces:
- Source filtering against a predefined list of credible domains
